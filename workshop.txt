title=Dadge Steals PPG to Police Conversion
description=If you use the Dadge Steals RT Twin Turbo '91 Mod by IBrRus you've probably come across the rare PPG Pacecar.   I wasn't a huge fan of the Yellow/pink combo and decided to reskin it to be a Police Interceptor.

description=I've taken the PPG Pacecar and reskinned it to be a Kentucky State Sherriff Interceptor, including making the lightbar properly flash red and blue.  It has all the same functionality as the PPG Racecar including all the up-armoring that the ATADadge vehicles allow and it's spawn rarity.  It is simply now a police car. That's it.
